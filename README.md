## Repository structure

* the demosthenes_dataset folder contains the tagged documents in xml format
* xmlToJson.py is a python script that converts the dataset into json format
* create_df.py is a python script that generates two dataframes: the first one contains the annotated sentences with their attributes, while the second contains all the documents' sentences and it is used for the AD task
* argumentmining.py defines the functions that perform the classification tasks
* run_experiments.py calls the argumentmining.py functions with the desired parameters


## How to run the experiments

* run xmlToJson.py to convert the xml dataset into the required json format
* run create_df.py to create the dataframes
* open run_experiments.py to choose the tasks, embeddings and classifiers, or run it as it is to get the complete set of experiments
